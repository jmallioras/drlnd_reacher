### Project Details

In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

### Solving the Environment

The agents must get an average score of +30 (over 100 consecutive episodes, and over all agents). Specifically,
at teh end of each episode, I sum the undiscounted rewards received by every agent to compute an individual score for each agent. 
This results in 20 distinct scores of which I take the mean value. Thus, I get the episode's average score
which represents the average score across all 20 agents.

The environment is solved when these average scores are above 30.0 across 100 episodes.
## Requirements
In order to prepare the environment, follow the next steps after downloading this repository:
* Create a new environment:
	* __Linux__ or __Mac__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6
	source activate drlnd
	```
	* __Windows__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name dqn python=3.6 
	activate drlnd
	```
* Min install of OpenAI gym
	* If using __Windows__, 
		* download [swig for windows](http://www.swig.org/Doc1.3/Windows.html) and add it the PATH of windows
		* install [ Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools ](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/es/downloads/).
	* then run these commands
	```bash
	pip install gym
	pip install gym[classic_control]
	pip install gym[box2d]
	```
* Install the dependencies under the folder [python/] (https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/python).
```bash
	cd python
	pip install .
```
* Create an IPython kernel for the `drlnd` environment
```bash
	python -m ipykernel install --user --name drlnd --display-name "drlnd"
```


* Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:

    - **_Version 1: One (1) Agent_**

        - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

    (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Linux_NoVis.zip) (version 1) or [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Linux_NoVis.zip) (version 2) to obtain the "headless" version of the environment.  You will **not** be able to watch the agent without enabling a virtual screen, but you will be able to train the agent.  (_To watch the agent, you should follow the instructions to [enable a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md), and then download the environment for the **Linux** operating system above._)


* Unzip the downloaded file and move it inside the project's root directory
* Change the kernel of you environment to `drlnd`

## Getting started
After having installed all the project requirements, you can test or re-train the agent.
To observe the trained agent in action, simply execute on your terminal:
```
python test_agent.py
```
Otherwise, you can change the value of hyperparameters, alter the DNN design and train the agents using:
```
python train_agent.py
```

## Demonstration of the trained agent
